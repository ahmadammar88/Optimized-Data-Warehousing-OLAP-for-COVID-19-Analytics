Optimized Data Warehousing and OLAP for COVID-19 Analytics
This project presents a comprehensive data warehousing and OLAP solution designed to support pandemic-related decision-making by public health authorities such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Developed in collaboration with Shazmeen Nasir, the system leverages SQL Server, Dimensional Fact Modeling (DFM), and materialized views to optimize performance on large-scale COVID-19 datasets.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
âœ… Designed a Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) for multidimensional analysis

âœ… Built a fully normalized data warehouse schema in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

âœ… Created indexed materialized views for rapid query execution

âœ… Implemented OLAP operations: slice, dice, drill-down, pivoting

âœ… Focused on tracking:

Daily new cases and deaths

ICU admissions

Vaccination progress

Quarantine and treatment statistics

ðŸ“‚ Structure
